# Daily Social

Daily Social is an application that serves unique, daily AI challenges to improve your social skills.

As part of a new creative pursuit, I wanted to create a YouTube channel where I could help people improve their social skills and develop a positive mindset. For a while, I was writing daily challenges on X, but I figured I'd make it into an app instead.

This application uses ChatGPT to generate these challenges. Users can upvote/downvote specific challenges and mark them complete when they're done.

This data is ephemeral(ish) in that it only lasts a day (according to UTC).
